NOTE:
This code is meant to be used on a high CPU server running on it's own
separate API, as to not place a heavy burden on the main API.

It should be used as part of the main API for debugging purposes only.

Access to this endpoint is restricted for INTERNAL USE ONLY, and it is to ONLY
be called from inside the main API.

This file essentially acts as a replacement for controllers.js when used on
its own server. Ideally, it would actually be called controllers.js, but
for debugging purposes can stay as navigation.js since controllers.js contains
lots of different stuff on the main servers.
---
Additionally, please be aware of some specific deviations from the pseudo-code:

1. In the pseudo-code, LatLng is represented as an object that holds a
lat/lon pair. Rather than using an object, in this case an array is simply
used to hold the pair. As a result of this, lat/lon will need to be sent
separately in the req.body.

2. The same occurs with BoundingBox, as bounding box is basically the same as
LatLng, or at least serves an almost identical purpose.

In the cases of 1 and 2:
LATITUDE is represented by array[0], and
LONGITUDE is represented by array[1].
In the case of 2
NE is represented by array[0], and
SW is represented by array[1].

3. Given JS's flexibility with variable types (having no explicit typing),
we can only hope that JS assumes that certain variables are to be treated as
doubles, others as ints, etc.

4. Regarding the for-each loops: It's not the same as Java man... It just isn't
the same... I have to be inefficient and write regular for loops instead.

If this is not an adequate representation of the psuedo-code as it was intended,
please let me know and appropriate changes will be made. Hopefully that won't
be necessary.
